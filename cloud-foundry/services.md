## Sharable Services
Service sharing across spaces needs to be enabled globally by a platform admin
A shared service cannot be renamed or updated
Deleting the service from any space it is shared in deletes it everywhere
```
--- share service ---
$ cf share-service training-app-db -s services
Sharing service instance training-app-db into org student-ssxfh8 / space services as student-ssxfh8...
OK

--- unshare service ---
cf unshare-service training-app-db -s services
WARNING: Unsharing this service instance will remove any existing bindings originating from the service instance in the space "services". This could cause apps to stop working.

Really unshare the service instance training-app-db from space services? [yN]: 
Unsharing service instance training-app-db from org student-ssxfh8 / space services as student-ssxfh8...
OK
```
- Note, a service is shared from the space it was created in
- Insecting a shared service will only show bound apps for the space it is in

## User created servces 
Cannot be shared across spaces
```
--- Create from file ---
$ cf create-user-provided-service
